My algorith MuLerp (Multiple Linear Interpolation) takes 3 parameters.
1st is a float array of Source points
2nd is a float array of Destination points
3rd is a float which determines the amount of interpolation
returns results in a float array

Then assuming we have equal length of array's; every element of same index starting from source 
moves to destination point by the amount of parameter 3, these new values are returned by a float array[]

If our assumption is wrong then this method returns null.
